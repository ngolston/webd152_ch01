    <h2>Moscow mule</h2>
    <p>
        A Moscow mule is a cocktail made with vodka, ginger beer and lime juice, garnished with a slice or wedge of lime
        and a sprig of mint. The drink is a type of buck and is sometimes called a vodka buck. The Moscow mule is
        popularly served in a copper mug, which takes on the cold temperature of the liquid. Some public health
        advisories recommend copper mugs be plated with nickel or stainless steel on the inside and the lip, but it has
        been disputed whether the time and acidity involved in the drinking of a Moscow mule would be enough to leach
        out the 30 milligrams of copper per litre needed to cause copper toxicity.
